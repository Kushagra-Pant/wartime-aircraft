    </body>
    <body>
        <p>We come to the most recent Generation of Jets, the fifth generation. The 4 aircraft considered part of this generation are the F-22, F-35, Sukhoi SU-57, and Chengdu J-20, but more are expected to come. With the Cold War slowing down in the Early 1990s-Late 2010s, aircraft innovation has come to a slow, compared with the previous generations. Don't get me wrong- these aircraft have massive improvements from the previous generations in ways such as extreme maneuverability and integration with information technology, but Generation 5 is the longest generation of aircraft, which means these developments were spread out over a long period of time. Also, lots of nations are investing in drones rather than jets, as remote-controlled warfare is the future.</p>
